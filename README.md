Scraping our discord (and soon OneNote) to make a universally searchable index for our team. This isn't the most well written but rn its a proof of concept. It'll probably get a full rewrite soon (TM).

# Instructions:
TBD

# Troubleshooting
* make sure all the python libraries are installed
* you need uv installed, and a beefy machine for vector creation
